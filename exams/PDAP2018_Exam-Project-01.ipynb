    "This is the first graded homework assignment for the course *Practical Data Analysis with Python*.  There will be two more graded homework assignment later during the semester; your total course grade will consist of the aggregated grades of all threehomework assignments.\n",

    "## Rules and regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to submit\n",
    "This homework must be submitted by Tuesday, 22 May 2018, 08:00:00 CET\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to submit\n",
    "For now, you can submit this homework assignment by sending the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to [hilboll@uni-bremen.de](mailto:hilboll@uni-bremen.de).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will post instructions on how to submit your assignment via GitHub later.\n",

    "**Note:** It is *your* responsibility to make sure that your homework submission reaches me in time.  If in doubt, submit early and ask me if I received your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical requirements\n",
    "Your solution has to be written to this Jupyter Notebook.  Please rename the notebook so that your last name(s) is/are included in the filename.  Your solution has to consist of exactly one (i.e., this) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study groups\n",
    "You are allowed to complete this homework assignment either alone or in groups of up to two students.  In case you do not do your homework alone, please clearly state who has contributed how much to which part of the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "At the end of the semester, there will be a separate ~20 minute oral discussion for each study group, in which all students are expected be able to demonstrate that they understand the code they submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using internet resources\n",
    "You are allowed to use book and/or internet resources to complete this homework assignment.  However, you are expected to a) clearly state any reference you have used to complete the assigment (e.g., by giving the URL to a website in a code comment), and b) to be able to explain the code you are writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "You will be graded on all *tasks* laid out below.  There are some possibilities to earn extra credit, clearly indicated in the task description."

    "Ozone is often measured using [ozonesondes](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ozwv/ozsondes/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work with ozonesonde measurements from the [Oberpreissenberg observatory](https://www.dwd.de/EN/research/observing_atmosphere/composition_atmosphere/hohenpeissenberg/start_mohp_node.html) in Southern Germany.  The data are available from the [World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre](https://woudc.org/data/explore.php).\n",

    "## Obtaining the data files\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files needed for this assignment can be downloaded at https://seafile.zfn.uni-bremen.de/f/4579f0c70b0d4368a610/.  Unpack that `.zip` archive to a folder somewhere on your harddrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- The filename of the data files (`*.csv`) contains information about the date of the flight in its first 8 characters.\n",
    "- The data files contain a lot of metadata which is of no interest in this assignment.  The data that you're interested in comes after the line `#PROFILE`, with one row per individual measurement."
