Git
===============

There are a number of free Git resources available on the internet, most
notably

- `Pro Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`__, a good reference book,
   also available in other languages (`Español
   <https://git-scm.com/book/es>`__, `Français
   <https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2>`__, `日本語
   <https://git-scm.com/book/ja>`__, `한국어
   <https://git-scm.com/book/ko>`__ `Nederlands
   <https://git-scm.com/book/nl>`__, `Русский
   <https://git-scm.com/book/ru>`__, `Українська
   <https://git-scm.com/book/uk>`__, `简体中文
   <https://git-scm.com/book/zh>`__). Partial translations exist for
   other languages as well; check the sidebar of the English version.
-  `Das Git Buch <http://gitbu.ch/>`__ is another good reference book,
   written in German.
-  The best resource for finding answers to specific questions is
   undoubtedly `stackoverflow.com <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__.


Python
======

The Python working environment
------------------------------

- `Managing conda environments
  <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`__
- When disk space is an issue, you can use the `conda clean
  <https://conda.io/docs/commands/conda-clean.html>`__ command to free
  up used space.  ``conda clean -t -p`` should remove all downloaded
  intermediate files from your conda installation without actually
  removing any installed packages (it will only remove temporary
  installation files).


The Python language in general
------------------------------

- `The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`__ is a great, free, general book about using Python.
- `A Whirlwind Tour of Python <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb>`__ is a notebook-based introduction into Python basics, highly recommended.


Python in science
-----------------

Books
~~~~~

- A great book about Python in data analysis is the `Python Data
  Science Handbook
  <https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>`__ by Jake
  van der Plas.  It is also available in printed form.


Lectures
~~~~~~~~

Two good general resources about Python in science are:

- `Python Scientific Lecture Notes <https://scipy-lectures.github.io/index.html>`__
- `J. R. Johansson's Lectures on Scientific Computing with Python <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/tree/master>`__


Cookbooks / Example galleries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- One great resource is https://ipython-books.github.io/


Comparison to other languages
-----------------------------

-  If you know Matlab, then `Numpy for Matlab
   users <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`__
   might help.
-  The `Thesaurus of Mathematical
   Languages <http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/>`__ gives
   "translations" between Python and Matlab, R, Numeric, and IDL.
   **CAUTION:** This document is rather old, some details might not out
   of date.
